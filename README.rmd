__Please create github [issues](https://github.com/mhealthgroup/MIMSunit/issues/) if you have any question related to the package.__

## Short introduction

MIMS-unit is abbreviated for _Monitor Independent Movement Summary_ unit. This measurement is developed to harmonize the processing of accelerometer data from different devices. You may refer to the [manuscript](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jmpb/2/4/article-p268.xml) for the detail description of the algorithm.

## Copyright and citation

The copyright of the work belongs to Northeastern University, [mHealth Research Group](https://mhealthgroup.org). Please kindly [cite the manuscript](authors.html) if you have used the package or referred to the algorithm in your work.

## System Requirements

1. R (>3.5.1)
2. memory (> 4GB)

### For Windows

Rtools 3.5 (see: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

### For Linux (use ubuntu as an example)

Install depedency system packages for `devtools`: `build-essential`, `libcurl4-gnutls-dev`, `libxml2-dev`, `libssl-dev`. 

## Installation

1. Stable version on CRAN (bundled or binary)

  _Coming soon..._

2. Development version (source codes)
  - For Windows users  
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("qutang/MIMSunit", type='win.binary')
```
  - For mac or Linux users  
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("qutang/MIMSunit")
```
  
_Note: It is recommended to use Rstudio when installing the package, because `devtools` has some compatible issues with R command line interface._

## Usage

```r
MIMSunit::mims_unit(input_dataframe, dynamic_range=c(-3,3), epoch='1 min')
```

Assume the input dataframe is in following format, with the first column (timestamp) in `POSXlct` objects and the device used to collect this data has dynamic range being -3g to 3g. You may set the epoch length to be `1 min`, `1 sec`, `5 sec`, `10 sec` and so on.
